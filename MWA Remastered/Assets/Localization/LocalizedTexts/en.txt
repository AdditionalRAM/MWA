Your wife
Gray boxes
Hello, young one.
The weather is pretty nice today.
Wanted to talk about something?
My wife?
She has a story she loves telling everyone.
Maybe you should go listen to her.
The gray boxes are monster spawners.
They create monsters after a while.
If you ever see one blinking, that indicates a monster spawning.
You better run away if that's the case.

Kologrent exit
The cave
Hello.
Heard you went into the cave, glad to see you're OK.
Got anything to talk about?
The exit???!?!!
Why? Are you looking to get out of here?
The exit is at the east end of Maze Forest.
First the cave, now the exit... Gosh, kids these days....
There are skeletons in the cave?
And puzzles?
And another skeleton that is giant and throws bones?
Wow. How did you survive that? You must be really brave.
Hi, honey.
Did you want to talk about something?
Oh, I see, you would like to hear about the story.
Hey, I would actually love some daisy tea right now.
Why don't you collect some daisies for me near the lake...
so I can tell you the story while we drink some tea? I will need 3.
The village entrances have been closed for a while.
Because of all the monsters since the incident, the village only has one entrance.
Outside the village is not very secure.

The Story
Village Entrances
Great! Now let me make the tea and then I will tell the story.
Honey, could you collect some daisies for me near the lake? I will need 3.
So that was the story.
My son, who is currently opening a shop, wanted to attempt to save him.
After some progress he decided it was too dangerous and stopped. I also think it is very dangerous.
I just wish he could get a proper job.
Thanks for listening to my story, I love telling it.
The tea is nice as well.
The tea is really nice.
Wow, heard you went in the cave.
You are attempting a rescue? That is so dangerous!
Well, if you are so determined...
In order to find the parts, you definetely need to go out of Kologrent.
Now that you have the key, you can go to the east exit of Maze Forest.
There is a door, which he key should open, but be careful, nobody knows what's behind that door.
Good luck!
I am making a shop.
This is the time! This time I will be successful!
It's not ready yet, so come back later. (please)
Fuat
Don't you see I'm busy!
Huh. I guess I can take a little break to talk.
What's up?
I want to buy from your shop
I want to save him.
OH REALLY?!?!?!?!
I ALREADY GOT MY FIRST CUSTOMER YAY
But the shop is not ready yet.
Please come and buy from the shop once it's ready!
HIM?
You want to save... HIM?
I was trying to do exactly that a while back, but I decided it was too dangerous.
Many useful things are in my secret stash.
It is a locked trapdoor after the west end of Maze Forest.
Monster hearts would be really useful for my shop.
Take this: Bring me 5 monster hearts, and I'll give you the key.
Monster hearts will drop if you kill a monster. Might wanna ask around the village for a weapon.
Let's see your power!
I'll need 5 Monster Hearts if you want the key to my secret stash.
Damn, you really are powerful.
Here is the key I promised. As I said, the stash is a trapdoor on the east exit of Maze Forest.
Go and take whatever you want. Just don't tell anyone, ok?
My shop still isn't ready.
You went in the Kologrent Cave?
stop the cap
There were skeletons and flying bones?
Exactly as I remembered.
And what was at the end? 
What?
A huge skeleton who throws bones and small skeletons?
Damn u really good mate how did u survive that
My shop still isn't ready though.
Hello, wanna talk?
Woman
What are you cooking?
I need a self defence weapon
I am making bread.
Why, did you want some?
Unfortunately it will have to cook for a while, so I can't give you any now.
You need a self defence weapon?!?
Why would you need such a thing?
Oh right. The monsters have started spreading even more.
You know what, take this knife. It's not much, but should be enough for you.
Hope the knife will be useful for you!
I heard you went into the cave. Are you OK?
Did you get to use the knife?
You used it to get a better weapon?
You're welcome.
It's good that you didn't get hurt.
A long time ago, the robot and his minis used to rule the kingdom.
Everyone loved him, and he loved us.
But one day, they came....
They demanded the management of the kingdom,
and thereatened to open fire.
He did not accept it.
And they did what they said they would do.
They took the management to themselves,
and their leader declared himself as King.
They sealed the robot's minis, his robotic limbs and his head away.
Nobody knows where, or even dares to attempt rescue him or bring him back.
The chest is locked.
It appears to contain an important item.
The Kologrent Key is no longer here.
It seems to be locked. You might need a key.
Using the key, you unlocked the door. The key disappeared.
Aren't you forgetting something?
The huge chest in the middle of the room?
The cave seems dangerous.
A proper weapon and maybe some healing will come in handy.
Will you go in now?
Go in now
Go in later
Going in!
Better to go in later.
Reset boxes?
Reset
Back
The boxes were reset.
The boxes were not reset.
All gray tiles must have a box on top.
Use the sign above to reset boxes.
You dare steal my Big Key?
You won't survive against me!
Oof, you defeated me.
One doesn't always win.
Goodbye.
I have managed to get some information.
There is a locked gate at the east exit of Maze Forest.
I couldn't figure out how to get through yet.
Will update on this later.
In the cave at Kologrent Field could be something to open it.
I'm not ready to go in yet, need to find a better weapon than my current kitchen knife.
I got a sword.
I will gather some more information before entering.
The door seems to be a way to leave Kologrent.
I definetely need to go through in order to continue my research and operation.
I am now looking to go and loot Kologrent Cave.
It is just way too hard.
I never thought there would be so many monsters in Kologrent Cave.
I can't really use the sword properly.
Might be worth it to take some sword training.
